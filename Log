We will write here the changes we implemanted, the date it was done on.


25/03: Tom
I did the Construction of the AVLnodes, self.size & self.balanceFactor
I added the size field to the nodes- so we can have a rank tree and implemnt listToArray() with it.
I did the set functions of the Nodes.
listToArray(), AVLTree empty(), AVLTree length(), AVLTree getRoot(), AVLTree retreive().
I made the four Rotations, we need to check it
I created a mini tester for some feilds of AVLNode- use it, we still need to work on the feilds.

I made tests for the AVLnode class, and the four rotations, and everything works :)
I made tests for the Reterieve() and ListToArray(), and everything works :)


27/03: Tom
I made Successor (AVLNode), insertFirst, insertLast functions, but did not test yet

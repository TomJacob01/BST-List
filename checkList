Adelina:
need to enter your name and id
please go through all the functions i implemanted today and try to understand them. if something is unclear let me know :)

Both of us:
need to create a tester for the existing functions, and debugs the code
we need to focus on the AVLNode class and make sure it's Done :)
we should start with debugging AVLNOde: setSize(), GetHeight(), setBalanceFactor() by this order
